## Overview
Capstone project for Digital Innovation Concentration focused on improving Georgia State University housing check-in processes. Goal: reduce lead time, eliminate non-value-added steps, and enhance student experience.

## Business Context
- Enhance on-campus housing experience
- Cultivate safe, inclusive learning environment
- Key KPIs: Retention Rate, Occupancy Rate, Cost per Student, Number of Safety Incidents, Student Satisfaction
## My Role
- Modeled AS-IS and TO-BE workflows in Bizagi Studio
- Conducted process analysis and identified non-value-added steps
- Created process documentation, diagrams, and KPI analysis
- Led recommendations to streamline verification and reduce lead time
## Problem
Current check-in process includes multiple verification checks performed by Resident Assistants (RAs), causing:
- Longer wait times
- Non-value-added repetitions
- Delays in key issuance and record updates

## Approach
- Mapped As-Is process using Bizagi Studio
- Identified pain points and wastes (lead time, duplicate checks)
- Designed To-Be process with:
  - Pre-arrival verification via self-service forms
  - Lobby computer for PantherID scanning
  - Reduced RA verification steps
- Proposed implementation and mitigated obstacles (cost, tech failures, resistance to change)

## Solution / Outcome
- Reduced process time and student wait times
- Streamlined verification without losing accuracy
- Introduced self-service precursory check and automated key management workflow
- Produced swim lane diagrams and documentation for stakeholders
