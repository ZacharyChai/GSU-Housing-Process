# GSU Housing Check-In Process Optimization

Capstone project focused on improving the efficiency, accuracy, and student experience of Georgia State University’s on-campus housing check-in process. Using Bizagi Studio, we mapped AS-IS and TO-BE workflows, identified non-value-added steps, and redesigned the process to reduce lead time and operational friction.

---

## My Role
- Modeled AS-IS and TO-BE workflows in Bizagi Studio  
- Conducted process analysis and identified inefficiencies  
- Created KPI definitions and documented requirements  
- Developed redesign recommendations to streamline verification  
- Produced process documentation and contributed to final report

## Business Context
Georgia State University Housing aims to provide a safe, inclusive living environment and a smooth move-in experience. Key performance indicators influencing the check-in process include:

- **Retention Rate**  
- **Occupancy Rate**  
- **Cost per Student**  
- **Number of Safety Incidents**  
- **Student Satisfaction**

The check-in workflow affects both operational efficiency and first-impression experience for thousands of students during move-in season.

---

## Problem Statement
The existing check-in process contained multiple issues:

- Resident Assistants (RAs) performed repetitive verification checks  
- Students without completed prerequisites caused bottlenecks  
- Missing keys or mismatched access cards created delays  
- Processes varied across dorm locations  
- Long lines and repeated interactions reduced student satisfaction  

These inefficiencies created additional lead time per student and introduced non-value-added steps.

## Approach
We conducted a full process analysis:

1. **Mapped the AS-IS workflow** using Bizagi  
2. Identified waste using Lean principles (rework, waiting, motion)  
3. Defined process metrics (Lead Time, Error Rate, Ease of Use)  
4. Designed an improved TO-BE workflow  
5. Proposed technology-supported changes including a self-service check and lobby computer  
6. Evaluated implementation challenges and mitigation strategies

## Key Improvements in the TO-BE Process
- **Introduced a Lobby Computer:**  
  Scans PantherIDs and retrieves pre-verified data before students reach the RA or Key Manager.

- **Reduced RA Verification Load:**  
  Moved documentation and prerequisite checks to a pre-arrival self-service form.

- **Consolidated Key Retrieval Steps:**  
  Key Manager receives correct info earlier, reducing back-and-forth communication.

- **Minimized Repeat Interactions:**  
  Eliminated situations where incomplete students rejoined the line multiple times.

These changes reduce total processing time and improve overall student experience.

## Potential Challenges & Solutions
| Challenge | Potential Solution |
|----------|--------------------|
| Cost to build new precursory check system | Use existing Housing portal and Qualtrics tools |
| Loss of human interaction | Maintain RAs for essential touchpoints |
| Lobby computer failure | Provide backup devices or IT onsite |
| Resistance to change | Highlight benefits and keep scope controlled |
